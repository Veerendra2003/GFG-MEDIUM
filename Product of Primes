Given two numbers L and R (inclusive) find the product of primes within this range. Print the product modulo 109+7. If there are no primes in that range you must print 1.

Example 1:

Input: L = 1, R = 10
Output: 210
Explaination: The prime numbers are 
2, 3, 5 and 7.
Example 2:

Input: L = 1, R = 20
Output: 9699690
Explaination: The primes are 2, 3, 
5, 7, 11, 13, 17 and 19.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function primeProduct() which takes L and R and returns the product of the primes within the range. If there are no primes in that range then return 1.

Expected Time Complexity: O((R-L)*(logR))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(sqrt(R))

Constraints:
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 109
0 ≤ L - R ≤ 106

================


//User function Template for Java

class Solution{
    static long primeProduct(long L, long R){
        // code here
        long pro=1;
        for(long i=L; i<=R; i++){
            if(isPrime(i)==true)
            pro = (pro%1000000007*i%1000000007)%1000000007;
        }
        return pro;
    }
    static public  boolean isPrime(long n){
       if(n==1)
       return false;
       for(int i=2; i<=Math.sqrt(n); i++){
           if(n%i==0)
           return false;
       }
       return true;
   }
}
